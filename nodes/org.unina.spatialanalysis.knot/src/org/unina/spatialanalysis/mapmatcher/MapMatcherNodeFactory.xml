    <shortDescription>
        Match a route, described as a WKT-like Linestring, to the traversed street segments.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node takes a route, encoded as a WKT Linestring, and matches it to a sequence of traversed OSM road segments, that can be analyzed
        	   by the coverage analyzer nodes in KNOT. 
        </intro>
        
        
        <option name="Coordinate Input Format">Either {lon,lat} or {lat,lon}.</option>
        <option name="OSM Data File">The path in which the .osm file containing the map data can be found.</option>
        <option name="OSRM Host">The url at which the OSRM instance used for map-matching can be reached</option>
        <option name="Include Never Visited Segments">By enabling this checkbox also the segments that were never visited
        will be added to the result table. If not, only the segments visited at least once will show up in the result.</option>
